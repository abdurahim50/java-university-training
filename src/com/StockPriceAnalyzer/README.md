# Stock Price Analysis System

## Overview
This assignment will assess your skills and knowledge in handling arrays and ArrayLists in Java, implementing methods to perform essential stock price analysis.

## Project Context
You have been given an array of integers representing the daily stock prices of a company for a given period. Additionally, you are provided with an `ArrayList` of stock prices for the same period. Your task is to implement a program that performs various analytical operations on these stock prices.

## Requirements
### Functionalities to Implement
#### 1. Calculate the Average Stock Price
- Implement a method `calculateAveragePrice` that:
    - Takes an **array of stock prices** as input.
    - Returns the **average price** of the stocks.

#### 2. Find the Maximum Stock Price
- Implement a method `findMaximumPrice` that:
    - Takes an **array of stock prices** as input.
    - Returns the **maximum price** among all stock prices.

#### 3. Determine the Occurrence Count of a Specific Price
- Implement a method `countOccurrences` that:
    - Takes an **array of stock prices** and a **target price** as input.
    - Returns the **number of times** the target price occurs in the array.

#### 4. Compute the Cumulative Sum of Stock Prices
- Implement a method `computeCumulativeSum` that:
    - Takes an **ArrayList of stock prices** as input.
    - Returns a **new ArrayList** containing the cumulative sum of prices at each position.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Ensure that the input **array and ArrayList are not null** and contain at least one element.
- Utilize **loops (for, while)** for processing both the array and ArrayList.
- Use **appropriate data structures** for efficient computation.
- Provide **error handling** to manage unexpected inputs.

## Assessment Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. **Correctness and Efficiency**: Each method correctly implements the required functionality.
2. **Code Readability**: Clean and well-structured code with appropriate variable names and comments.
3. **Error Handling**: The program gracefully handles invalid inputs.
4. **Use of Java Features**: Proper utilization of loops, data structures, and best practices in Java.
5. **Documentation**: Clear explanation of the purpose and usage of each method.

## Running the Program
To run the **Stock Price Analysis System**, follow these steps:
1. Compile the Java files using:
   ```sh
   javac StockPriceAnalysis.java
   ```
2. Run the main class:
   ```sh
   java StockPriceAnalysis
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform stock price analysis.

Ensure Java is installed on your system before executing the program.
