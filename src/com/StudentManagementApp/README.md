# Student Management System GUI

## Overview
This assignment assesses your skills and knowledge in creating interactive GUI applications using Java's GUI frameworks, such as Swing or JavaFX. The application should include event handling mechanisms to respond dynamically to user interactions.

## Project Context
You have been assigned to develop a **Student Management System** with a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage student records, course enrollments, and grades. The system should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide real-time updates based on user actions.

## Requirements

### GUI Design
- Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Utilize Java's GUI frameworks (Swing or JavaFX).
- Include components such as labels, text fields, buttons, tables, and menus.
- Ensure the GUI is aesthetically pleasing and logically organized.

### Student Management Functionality
- Enable adding new students, updating student information, and viewing student details.
- Implement event handlers for buttons/menu items to trigger corresponding actions.
- Ensure:
    - Clicking "Add Student" displays a form to input student details.
    - Clicking "Update Student" allows modification of existing student information.
    - Clicking "View Student Details" presents a list of students and their details.

### Course Enrollment Functionality
- Allow enrollment of students into courses via the GUI.
- Implement event handlers for selecting courses and enrolling students.
- Ensure:
    - A dropdown or list displays available courses.
    - A list of eligible students is shown for selection.
    - Administrators can select a student and enroll them in a course.

### Grade Management Functionality
- Provide functionality for assigning grades to students.
- Implement event handlers for selecting students, courses, and grades.
- Ensure:
    - A student is selected from a list.
    - Their enrolled courses and current grades are displayed.
    - Administrators can assign or update grades.

### Dynamic Interface Updates
- Ensure the interface updates dynamically based on user interactions.
- Update student lists, course enrollments, and grade records in real-time.
- Reflect changes instantly without requiring manual refresh.

### Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling mechanisms.
- Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs or unsuccessful operations.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to maintain responsiveness and usability.

### Documentation
- Provide clear documentation explaining:
    - The purpose of each GUI component and event handler.
    - The design choices behind the interface.
    - Instructions for running and interacting with the application.

## Assessment Criteria
1. **GUI Design**: Well-organized, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.
2. **Implementation**: Correct use of Swing/JavaFX with functional components.
3. **Student Management**: Efficiently adding, updating, and viewing student details.
4. **Course Enrollment**: Smooth enrollment process with clear user interactions.
5. **Grade Management**: Effective grade assignment with an intuitive workflow.
6. **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time interface updates reflecting all changes.
7. **Error Handling**: Robust validation and exception handling for a smooth experience.
8. **Documentation**: Clear and comprehensive explanation of system functionality.

## Running the Program
To run the **Student Management System GUI**, follow these steps:
1. Compile all Java files:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
2. Run the main class:
   ```sh
   java Main
   ```
3. Use the GUI to add students, enroll in courses, and assign grades.
